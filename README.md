3. Click **Finish** to complete the setup

## üéõÔ∏è Usage

### Climate Entities

Each AC unit will appear as a climate entity in Home Assistant with the following controls:

- **Power**: Turn the AC on/off
- **Mode**: Select HVAC mode (Fan, Cool, Dry, Auto)
- **Temperature**: Set target temperature
- **Fan Speed**: Control fan speed
- **Swing**: Control vertical swing position

### Automation Examples

```yaml
# Turn on AC when temperature is high
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on AC when hot"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
        above: 28
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bluestar_ac_living_room
        data:
          hvac_mode: cool
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bluestar_ac_living_room
        data:
          temperature: 24

# Turn off AC when leaving home
automation:
  - alias: "Turn off AC when leaving"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.you
        to: "not_home"
    action:
      - service: climate.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bluestar_ac_living_room
```

### Lovelace Card Example

```yaml
type: thermostat
entity: climate.bluestar_ac_living_room
name: Living Room AC
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Control Algorithm

This integration uses the same multi-step control algorithm from our working webapp:

1. **Primary Method**: MQTT Shadow Updates to AWS IoT
2. **Fallback Method**: HTTP API with nested mode preferences
3. **Force Sync**: Ensures device state synchronization

### API Compatibility

- **100% Compatible**: Uses exact same API calls as the original Bluestar app
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status monitoring every 30 seconds
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms

### MQTT Integration

- **Protocol**: MQTT over TLS (mqtts://)
- **Authentication**: AWS IoT credentials
- **Topics**: 
  - Control: `things/{device_id}/control`
  - Shadow Update: `$aws/things/{device_id}/shadow/update`

## üìä Supported Devices

This integration supports all Bluestar Smart AC units that work with the official Bluestar mobile app, including:

- Bluestar Smart AC models with WiFi connectivity
- All AC units registered in your Bluestar account
- Units with MQTT and HTTP API support

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration won't load:**
- Check your credentials are correct
- Ensure your AC units are connected to WiFi
- Check Home Assistant logs for error details

**AC not responding:**
- Verify your AC unit is online in the Bluestar app
- Check network connectivity
- Try restarting the integration

**Temperature not updating:**
- The integration updates every 30 seconds
- Check if the AC unit is reporting temperature correctly
- Verify the AC unit's temperature sensor is working

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.bluestar_ac: debug
```

### Log Analysis

Look for these log patterns:

- `‚úÖ MQTT Connected`: MQTT connection successful
- `‚úÖ Successfully logged in`: API authentication successful
- `üì§ MQTT Publishing`: Control commands being sent
- `‚ùå MQTT Connection error`: Connection issues

## üîÑ Updates

The integration automatically checks for updates when installed via HACS. For manual installations, download the latest release and replace the files.
